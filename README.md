# python-dvdvideo

Archiving the work of the `python-dvdvideo` repos that seem to be abandoned (or at least not recently maintained) from what I can tell.

Typically `ddrescue` works for me when I need to back up an old family video DVD, but in some cases it fails. I've found the scripts here to be more reliable in those cases.

```
./dvdvideo-backup-image /dev/sr0 dvd.iso
```
